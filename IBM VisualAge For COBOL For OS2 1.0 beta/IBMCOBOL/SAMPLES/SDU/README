SAMPLE1.EXE
-----------
  SAMPLE1 has as input SAMPLE.ADL, an ADL source text with two
  DECLARE statements and two PLAN statements.
  SAMPLE1 calls the Parse function, the Generate function and the
  Conversion Plan Builder.

  Output files of SAMPLE1 are the following:
    SAMPLE_P.LST - Listing file of the Parse function
    SAMPLE_G.LST - Listing file of the Generate function
    SAMPLE.GEN   - Output file of the Generate function
    SAMPLE.SPC   - Conversion Plan Space, Output file of
                   Conversion Plan Builder

  If an error occurred in one of the API's called by SAMPLE1, the
  Condition token and, if necessary, the ADL Communication area
  is written to stdout.
  If no error occurred, only the output files are generated.

SAMPLE2.EXE
-----------
  SAMPLE2 has as input SAMPLE.SPC which was generated by SAMPLE1.
  SAMPLE2 calls the Conversion Plan Executor and executes the
  plans COBOL_TO_C and C_TO_COBOL specified in SAMPLE.ADL and
  encoded in the conversion plan plans.
  The input values are hard coded in the source code. The converted
  output values are written to stdout.

  If an error occurred in one of the API's called by SAMPLE2, the
  Condition token and, if necessary, the ADL Communication area
  is written to stdout.
