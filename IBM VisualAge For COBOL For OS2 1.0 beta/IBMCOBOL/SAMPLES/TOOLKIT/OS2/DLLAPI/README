DLLAPI - Dynamic Link Library


DESCRIPTION:

The sample has a dynamic link library (DLL) file and an executable (EXE)
file. The DLL provides the 32-bit API function that is called by the
EXE file. The EXE calls the function with invalid pointer parameters,
followed by a call with valid pointer parameters.

TASK:

The DLL uses protected memory to protect its shared data, and
exception management to validate the API's pointer parameters,
handling the errors returned.  Support PM functions in DLLs that
can be invoked from other executables.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

Demonstrates how to write and use a dynamic link library (DLL).
The EXE file demonstrates how to handle a divide-by-zero exception.

SAMPLE LOCATION:

Inside the OS/2 Sample Programs (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\os2\dllapi
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,
 link, and run the files, use the NMAKE tool.  Your output is the
 executable file. For information about the NMAKE utility,
 see the OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
