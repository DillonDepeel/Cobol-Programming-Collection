NPIPE - Named Pipes


DESCRIPTION:

NPIPE demonstrates two-way communication between two unrelated processes
using named pipe functions.  This sample program implements the game of
tic-tac-toe with two executable files, CLINPIPE.EXE (the client) and
SVRNPIPE.EXE (the server).  The server is the computer, and the client
is the user.  For example, the client will:

- Connect to the server and acknowledge successful connection
  (START_MSG).
- Notify the server through a pipe when it wishes to begin play
  (YOU_FIRST or CLIENT_MOVE).
- Notify the server when it wishes to quit (CLIENT_QUIT).
- Send the server a valid move when requested by the server
  (CLIENT_MOVE).

In turn, the server will:

- Upon the initial request of a client to play, connect a pipe
  to the client through which play will be executed (START_MSG).
- Be able to play with many clients simultaneously.
- Notify the client of the server's move, and request a valid move
  from the client (SERVER_MOVE).
- Notify the client of game-end (WIN_SERVER, WIN_CLIENT, WIN_DRAW).


TASK:
Play Tic-Tac_Toe using named pipes.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
Illustrate the use of Presentation Manager, threads and named pipes.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the OS/2 Sample Programs folder (which is inside the VisualAge C++
Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\os2\npipe
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
  Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
  To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
  prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
  have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
  and run the files, use the NMAKE tool.  Your output is the executable
  file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the OS/2 Tools
  Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
