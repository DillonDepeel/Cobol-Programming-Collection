TIMESERV - Timer Services


DESCRIPTION:

This sample program displays both an analog and digital clock.  To
simulate elapsed seconds, the main Presentation Manager thread
repeatedly sets a one-second window timer that updates the current time.  TIMESERV
features an audible and visual alarm that the user can set.  When the
time expires, the sample makes use If the DOS timer services and notifies the
user by sounding an alarm and displaying
a message box.

TASK:
This sample uses timing services to implement a PM Based clock.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
TIMESERV demonstrates how to use and implement window timers and
system-resource timers.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the OS/2 Sample Programs (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\os2\timeserv
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
