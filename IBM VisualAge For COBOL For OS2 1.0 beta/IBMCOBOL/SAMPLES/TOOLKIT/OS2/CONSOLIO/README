CONSOLIO - Console I/O


DESCRIPTION:

This sample program displays earth worms aimlessly moving about the
screen. Each worm is a separate thread with a unique color combination
and movement pattern. When one worm encounters another worm, the
color attribute of the worm is set to red.
The user can add or delete worms using the keyboard or mouse.

TASK:
Draw "Worms" on screen using OS/2 screen I/O routines.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
Demonstrates how to call video (Vio), keyboard (Kbd), and mouse (Mou)
16-bit functions from a 32-bit code segment.
Several mouse selectable options are shown to illustrate mouse input.
The code also illustrates the use of threads.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the OS/2 Sample Programs (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\os2\consolio
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.
