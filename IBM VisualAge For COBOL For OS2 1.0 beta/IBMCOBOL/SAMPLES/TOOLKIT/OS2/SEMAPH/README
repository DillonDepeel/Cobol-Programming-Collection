SEMAPH - Semaphore


DESCRIPTION:

In the sample, several threads share access to the same resource.  Event
semaphores are used to signal a thread to give up a resource. A mutex
semaphore is used to guarantee that only one thread has access to the
resource at a time. A mux semaphore provides a method to check
multiple event semaphores.

The event semaphore can be posted by the user, or run in auto mode,
in which case  the event semaphore will be posted at fixed time
intervals.  A mutex semaphore  is used to check for a stop event
or for a user signal to give up the resource.

Each thread can display as a different colored square similarly,
the resource can display as a rectangle, the color of which is that
of the first thread that owns it.

TASK:
Using semaphores, control access to shared resources.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
Demonstrates the use of mutex and event semaphores.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the OS/2 Sample Programs folder (which is inside the 
VisualAge C++ Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\os2\sempah
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
  Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool.  Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
