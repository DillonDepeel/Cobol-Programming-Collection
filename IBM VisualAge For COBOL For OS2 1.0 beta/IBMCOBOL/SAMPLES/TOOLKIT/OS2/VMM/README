VMM - Virtual Memory Management


DESCRIPTION:

  VMM demonstrates the use of virtual memory by using new memory-management
  functions to allocate and set the attributes of memory.  Users can read or
  write data into memory and reset the attributes using a dialog box.  The
  memory manager protects or opens the virtual memory to read or write
  operations according to the different attributes of each memory block.  To
  free memory, the user enters the address of the memory.

**
 This application serves two distinct purposes. First, The Demo menu 
 calls dialog boxes that demonstrate all of the controls available for
 use in a dialog box.


TASK:

  Use of menus and dialogs to allocate and set attributes of memory.

CONCEPT/FEATURE: 

 It demonstrates the standard menus and dialogs that most PM
 applications will contain. There is also a dialog box which
 demonstrates the setting and removing of control Presentation Parameters.
 Finally, the demo menu also has menu items that demonstrate the various 
 types of message boxes that the system supports.

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the OS/2 Sample Programs folder (which inside the
 VisualAge C++ Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\os2\vmm
 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.

SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:


- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
