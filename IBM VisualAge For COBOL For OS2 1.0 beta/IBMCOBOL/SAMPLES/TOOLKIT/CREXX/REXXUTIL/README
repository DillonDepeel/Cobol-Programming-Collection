REXXUTIL - REXX Utility Functions


DESCRIPTION:

REXXUtil demonstrates a set of external functions packaged in a dynamic
link library, including:

- Use of OS/2 system functions in REXX external functions.
- Techniques for passing large amounts of data to a REXX program using
  REXX compound variables as arrays.


TASK: 

Provides sample code for building a DLL which implements additional
REXX services.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

Sample for introducing REXX language extensions.

SAMPLE LOCATION

Inside the CREXX Sample Programs (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\crexx\rexxutil
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
- OS/2 Warp
