REXXCALC - Presentation Manager REXX Calculator


DESCRIPTION:
This application illustrates the steps required to develop enhanced applications.
The enhanced application chosen is a simple calculator.

TASK:
Provides sample code on building a simple calculator.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
This application illustrates the steps required to develop enhanced applications.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the CREXX Sample Programs (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\crexx\rexxcalc
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE

-From your OS/2 desktop:
Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
