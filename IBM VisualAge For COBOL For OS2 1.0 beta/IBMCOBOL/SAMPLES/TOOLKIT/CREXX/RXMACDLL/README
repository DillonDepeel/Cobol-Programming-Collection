RXMACDLL - The External Functions in REXX Macrospace Sample

DESCRIPTION:

  MACRO.C contains REXX external functions, which perform REXX macrospace
  operations.  RXNLSINF.C contains a REXX external function that provides
  information related to National Language Support (for example, as a currency
  symbol and separator).  RXMACDLL.CMD uses MACRO.DLL to load NLSMONEY.CMD into
  the macrospace and calls NLSMONEY.CMD several times to format currency
  amounts.  NLSMONEY.CMD formats the amounts according to the specifications
  provided by RXNLSINF.DLL.

  RXMACDLL can be run in an OS/2 full-screen session, an OS/2 window 
  session, or in PMREXX.

TASK:

  A set of external REXX macros available for use.

FEATURE/CONCEPT:

  This sample demonstrates the macrospace interface with two C-language
  programs: MACRO.C and RXNLSINF.C, which are compiled into two separate
  dynamic link libraries.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the CREXX Sample Programs inside the main VisualAge C++ for OS/2
folder on your OS/2 desktop.

Note: This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\crexx\rxmacdll
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.

HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:


- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
