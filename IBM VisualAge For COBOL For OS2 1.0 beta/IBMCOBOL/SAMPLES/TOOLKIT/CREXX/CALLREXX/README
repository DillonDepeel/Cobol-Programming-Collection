CALLREXX - REXX Interpreter Invocation

DESCRIPTION:
This sample demonstrates how a C-Language application calls a REXX
application.  To run the REXX application BACKWARD.FNC, CallREXX.C issues
REXXSart.  REXXStart calls the REXX interpreter and passes it a string of words.
BACKWARD.FNC returns a string, composed of the words of the original string but
in reverse order, to the C-language application.

TASK:
Given a string of words, CallREXX returns the string with the words in reverse order.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
The program CallREXX.c shows the programmatic interface to the
REXX interpreter by providing a sample call sequence to the REXX interpreter.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the CREXX Sample Programs (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note: This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\crexx\callrex
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.

HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
