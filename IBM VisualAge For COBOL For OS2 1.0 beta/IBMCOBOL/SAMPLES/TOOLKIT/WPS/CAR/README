CAR - WPS WPDataFile Subclass C


DESCRIPTION:

 CAR and CARPP demonstrate how to create a Workplace Shell object
 using basic object-oriented programming techniques and the
 System Object Model (SOM), including:

 - Initializing an object
 - Adding settings pages to an object
 - Saving and restoring the state of an object
  - Modifying object context menus (adding and deleting menu items)
 - Querying of object class data
 - Processing context menu items
 - Implementing settings page dialog processing

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 Illustrate the use of PM within the WPS

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the WPS Sample Programs inside the main VisualAge C++ for OS/2
 folder on your OS/2 desktop.

 Note: This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\wps\car

 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:  
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 Place the current directory on your INCLUDE path by typing

 SET INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%X:\ibmcpp\samples\wps\car
   
 where X is the drive on which you installed the samples and 
 document component of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.

 Then, to start the sample program, type the name of the executable 
 file and press Enter.  If you have edited source code of a sample 
 program and want to recompile, link, and run the files, use the 
 NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable file.  For information 
 about the NMAKE utility, see the OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
