  WPSTUTOR - The Workplace Shell Tutorial Sample
 
DESCRIPTION:

  The WPSTUTOR sample displays the order in which object methods are
  invoked by the Workplace Shell.  As a method for the sample object 
  class is executed, the method's name and a description of its functions 
  are displayed in a Presentation Manager window.  The sample saves its 
  title and the icon title backwards.

  This object class subclasses the WPDataFile class.  Most Workplace
  Shell instance and class methods are overridden so that information 
  about the methods can be displayed to the user.

  This sample is designed to be more of a tutorial for Workplace Shell
  programming than a programming example.

  NOTE:  The SHOWDESC.EXE file should be renamed to SHOWDESC.BAK
  (or something other than SHOWDESC.EXE) to turn off the sample.  
  Rename the file back to SHOWDESC.EXE to turn the sample back on.
