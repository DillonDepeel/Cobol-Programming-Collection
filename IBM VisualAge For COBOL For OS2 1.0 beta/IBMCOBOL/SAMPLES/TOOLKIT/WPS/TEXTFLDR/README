TEXTFLDR - The Text Only Folder Sample

DESCRIPTION:

  The TEXTFLDR sample allows only Plain Text objects to be placed in the
  folder.  Objects that are not Plain Text are rejected.  Objects are 
  considered to be Plain Text if the Associated Type in the Settings is 
  set to Plain Text.  If no type is set, the folder checks the first
  500 bytes.  If any characters are control- or extended- ASCII
  characters, the object is rejected.
