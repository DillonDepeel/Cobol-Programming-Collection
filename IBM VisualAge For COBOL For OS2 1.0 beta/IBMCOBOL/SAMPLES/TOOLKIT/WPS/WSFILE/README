WSFILE - The Workplace Shell File and Folder Sample
  
DESCRIPTION:

  The WSFILE sample displays, creates and installs Workplace objects of
  two classes: WSFILE and WSFOLDER.  Class WSFILE is a subclass of the
  WPDataFile class, and class WSFOLDER is a subclass of class WPFolder.
  The sample allows you to create a Workplace Shell folder on your 
  desktop.  To do this, run the command file called INSTALL.CMD, 
  providing the specification of the drive on which your OS/2 Warp
  system was installed.  For example, enter INSTALL C:

  The example folder which you create contains a WSFILE object and a

  object and drop it into the folder.
