:p.The Template Sample application is a sample Presentation Manager application
which an application developer can use as a base for his own applications.
The sample program uses many of the standard menus and dialogs that
most applications would use.  The source is designed to serve as a
base for any Presentation Manager application and was written in such
a way that it can be easily modified to handle any application specific
commands.
