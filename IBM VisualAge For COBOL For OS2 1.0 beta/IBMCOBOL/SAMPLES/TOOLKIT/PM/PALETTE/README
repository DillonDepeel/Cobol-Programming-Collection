PALETTE - Pallette Manager


DESCRIPTION:

 PALETTE demonstrates the creation of a window using a custom palette
 and animation.  The user can display an IBM logo or OS/2 logo.
 When run on a system having a fully populated XGA adapter, the
 sample shows a palette animation technique from a second thread of
 execution.

TASK:

 Display a standard window and draw the IBM or OS/2 logo in the window.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 This program demonstrates how to create and display a standard window,
 use switched menus, use a second thread for drawing, modify a palette
 using some basic GPI calls, and display vectored fonts.

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the PM Sample Programs folder (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
 Samples folder).

Note: This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\pm\pallette
 
 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.
