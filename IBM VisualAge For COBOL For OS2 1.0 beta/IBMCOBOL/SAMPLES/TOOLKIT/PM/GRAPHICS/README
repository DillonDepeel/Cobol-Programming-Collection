GRAPHICS - Non-retained Graphics


DESCRIPTION:

The sample program lets the user load metafiles using a dialog box.
The dialog box has a help pushbutton.  When the help pushbutton is
activated, it provides instructions on loading a metafile from another
directory. The user also can print a metafile or graphic circle.

TASK:
Load metafiles using a dialog box.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:
This program demonstrates the use of the default viewing
transformation, metafile loading and playing, the use of
dialog boxes, and file manipulation through Standard Open dialog.
It also demonstrates the use of an asynchronous drawing thread and
print thread.

SAMPLE LOCATION:
Inside the PM Sample Programs folder (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
Samples folder).

Note: This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\pm\graphics
where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
OS/2 Tools Reference.
