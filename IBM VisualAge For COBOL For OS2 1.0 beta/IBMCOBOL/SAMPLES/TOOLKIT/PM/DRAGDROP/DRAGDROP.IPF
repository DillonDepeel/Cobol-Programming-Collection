:i1 id=aboutMain.About Sample
:p.The Drag/Drop program is a sample Presentation Manager application
which illustrates direct manipulation.
:p.To show direct manipulation, start two instances of the sample
in separate windows.  In one of the sessions, open a directory from which
you want to see a file list, then select names of files you want to move.
In the other Drap/Drop session, open a
directory to which you want to move the files.  Perform the drag and drop by
holding down mouse button 2 in the first window.  Drag the
mouse across to the target window and release it.  The files will be moved to
the target directory.
