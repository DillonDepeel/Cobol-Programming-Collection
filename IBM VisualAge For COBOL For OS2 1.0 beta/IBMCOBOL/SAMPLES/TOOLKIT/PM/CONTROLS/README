CONTROLS - PM Controls


DESCRIPTION:

CONTROLS demonstrates a Presentation Manager application that conforms
with Common User Access* requirements and implements the following
new controls: Container, Notebook, Slider, Spin button, and Value set.

The sample program also demonstrates secondary windows, such as dialog
and message boxes.  The program lets the user edit and save text files.
Help, in IPF format, also is provided.

The code in CONTROLS is structured so that the addition of a new
function is handled in an efficient manner.  For example, to add a new
command to an existing menu, you need only add the command to the
resource file, then add the appropriate message-processing
routines to the STY_USER.C file.

TASK:
The program lets the user edit and save text files.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

- PM window creation
- Menu Creation
- Dialog box creation
- Presentation parameters
- Initialization and display of PM controls
- Help creation and initialization

where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
OS/2 Tools Reference.
