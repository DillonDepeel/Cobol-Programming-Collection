IPF - Information Presentation Facility


DESCRIPTION:

 IPF demonstrates how to use the Information Presentation Facility (IPF)
 to create an online document.  This sample program features customized
 windows that display text, graphics, and animation.

 Two files are associated with this sample:

 - The IPF online document (.INF) file
 - The OS/2 dynamic link library (.DLL) file.

 The .INF file is the compiled IPF tag document.  The source contains
 tagging that defines different types of windows.  Tags that control
 the format and display of text also are included in this file.

 The .DLL file is the compiled OS/2 C language source for the code
 object that is called when the .INF file is read during run time.  A
 series of bit maps used for animation are included in the DLL.

TASK:

 Create an online document using the Information Presentation Facility.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 This program illustrates a suggested format for sample Help Manager
 code using the Information Presentation Facility.

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the PM Sample Programs folder (which is inside the VisualAge C++ 
 Samples folder).

Note: This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\pm\ipf

 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.



SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
