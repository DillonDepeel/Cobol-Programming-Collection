DIVE  - Direct Interface Video Extensions


DESCRIPTION:

 Direct Interface Video Extensions (DIVE) provide optimized
 blitting performance for motion video subsystems and applications
 that perform rapid screen updates in the OS/2 PM and full-screen
 environments.

 Using DIVE interfaces, applications can either write directly to
 video memory or use the DIVE blitter.
 The DIVE blitter will take advantage of acceleration hardware
 when present and applicable to the function being performed.

TASK:

 A sample for using the DIVE APIs

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 Direct Interface Video Extensions demonstration

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the MM Sample Programs inside the main VisualAge C++ for OS/2
 folder on your OS/2 desktop.

 Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\mm\dive

 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:

- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.
