    This subdirectory contains the Codec Installation Sample.  This sample
    shows the developer of a video compression/decompresion algorithm how to
    have the algorithm installed into the MMPM/2 system so that it can then
    be used by the Digital Video Recorder to record software motion video.

    This sample should be used in conjunction with the sampcodc.dll file
    that is available in the \mmos2\mmtoolkt\samples\codec subdirectory.

    The files included with this sample are the following:

    vidrec.ico	 - The icon that shows up in the MINSTALL window next to
		   the text title of the codec.

    control.scr  - The first file read in by MINSTALL, which points to the
		   master file list (master.dsk), defines the source and
		   destination directory numbers, and all the file groups.
		   In the example, there is only one file (hence only one
		   group).  The group definition defines the group number
		   (to be used with the group number associated with the
		   files in the master.dsk), the size of the group in KBytes,
		   the name of the codec that appears on the MINSTALL line,
		   the version of the codec, a pointer to .INI file update
                   information, and default selection status.

    master.dsk	 - The main file describing the contents of the disk(s) that
		   need to be installed.  Each file to be installed has
		   an entry defining the disk number that the file resides on,
		   the group that the file is in, the number of the
		   destination directory, the number of the source directory,
		   and the filename itself.

    sampcodc.scr - Filelist control file containing the list of items to
		   be added to the MMPMMMIO.INI file by MINSTALL.  Some items
		   of interest are the FourCC of the file format, the .DLL
		   name, the .DLL entry point, the FourCC of the codec
		   algorithm, the capabilities of the codec (shouldn't need
		   updating), and the X and Y alignment definitions (which
                   describes how the codec encodes data if it does so in
                   blocks... this is important for decompression and window
                   placement).
