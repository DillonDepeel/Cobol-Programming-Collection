ADMCT - The Waveform Audio Media Control Driver Sample

DESCRIPTION:

 ADMCT is an example of a Media Control Driver (MCD) that
 demonstrates how to control a streaming device.
 Streaming devices use the services of the Sync/Stream Manager
 (SSM) of OS/2 multimedia to control the data stream from a source
 location to a target location.

TASK:

 Write a media control driver to control a streaming device


CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 Media control drivers, streaming devices and the Synch/Stream
 Manager

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the MM Sample Programs inside the main VisualAge C++ for OS/2	
 folder on your OS/2 desktop.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

   X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\mm\admct

 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
