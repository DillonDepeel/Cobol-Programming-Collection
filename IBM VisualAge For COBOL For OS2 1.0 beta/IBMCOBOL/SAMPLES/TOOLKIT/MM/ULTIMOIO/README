ULTIMOI - Ultimotion I/O Procedure


DESCRIPTION:

 The Ultiomotion I/O procedure provides a detailed example of
 what you need to consider when writing I/O procedures for
 software motion video file formats.

 ULTIMOIO includes CODEC support and illustrates how to integrate
 common and file-format-specific code to support multiple I/O
 procedures.

TASK:

 Provide a comprehensive example on IO Procedures needed to
 display motion video.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 IO Procedures for motion video files

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the MM Sample Programs inside the main VisualAge C++ for OS/2
 folder on your OS/2 desktop.

 Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\mm\ultimoio

 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:
