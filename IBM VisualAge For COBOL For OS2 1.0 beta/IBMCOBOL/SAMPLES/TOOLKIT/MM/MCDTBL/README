MCDTBL - Media Control Driver Command Tables


DESCRIPTION:

 Before an Media Control Driver (MCD) can interpret a string command, 
 the MDM must use a command table to change the string into an equivalent
 procedural command.  Represented as resources to the driver, command
 tables are created using the RCDATA type of resource.  The resource
 number of the RCDATA block is the device type number.  MCDTBL contains
 command tables for each of the following devices:

 - CD-ROM/XA
 - CD Audio
 - Wave Audio
 - Sequencer
 - Digital Video
 - Amp Mixer
 - Videodisc


 If you want to support device-specific messages, you must create a
 device-specific command table.

TASK:

 Provide a general model on how MCD command tables are set up.

CONCEPT/FEATURE:

 Template for coding an MCD

SAMPLE LOCATION:

 Inside the MM Sample Programs inside the main VisualAge C++ for OS/2
 folder on your OS/2 desktop.

 Note:This sample is not provided in project form.

SOURCE FILE LOCATION:

 X:\ibmcpp\samples\toolkit\mm\mcdtbl

 where X: is the drive you installed the samples and document component
 of VisualAge C++ for OS/2.


HOW TO RUN THE SAMPLE:

-From your OS/2 desktop:
 Double-click on the sample's icon.

-From an OS/2 command prompt:
 To start a non-WorkPlace Shell sample program from an OS/2 command
 prompt, type the name of the executable file and press Enter.  If you
 have edited source code of a sample program and want to recompile,link,
 and run the files, use the NMAKE tool. Your output is the executable
 file.  For information about the NMAKE utility, see the
 OS/2 Tools Reference.


SOFTWARE/HARDWARE PREREQUISITES:


- IBM VisualAge C++
- OS/2 Warp
- IBM or compatible 386 and up.

The following files are the command tables shipped with the MMPM/2 product.
