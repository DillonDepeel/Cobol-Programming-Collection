The CODE editor lets you edit source for programming languages.
It uses language editing features (such as syntax checking,
language sensitive help, and token highlighting) to help
you edit each specific programming language.

In this exercise, you will use the editor to edit basic text.

By the end of the exercise, you will be able to:

- Type in text, and get text from other files
- Use text blocking to copy, cut, and paste text.
- Mark lines of text, and find these marks again.
- Use some of the editing shortcut keys.
- Find specific text strings.
- Go to particular line numbers.
- Open more than one view of a file.
- Be introduced to some basic editor commands.
- Use the macro log to recover previous commands.

You will be able to apply what you learn here to
editing real programming source in later exercises.
