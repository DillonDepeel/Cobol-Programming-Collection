===== Installation =====================================

(1) Before installation of SEE4CB, your Windows COBOL compiler should
already be installed on your system and tested. 

(2) Create your SEE project directory, copy the SEE archive, then unzip
the archive. For example:

      MKDIR   SEE4CB
      PKUNZIP SEE4CB31.ZIP SEE4CB

(3) Run INSTALL.BAT, which will copy SEE32.DLL to your windows directory.

(4) Edit the example programs with your SMTP/POP3 parameters. Refer to
the SEE4CB Users Manual (SEE4CB_U.TXT) for more details.

(5) Compile, link, and execute the test programs.
