# The-COBOL-Archive
COBOL Lives on in this repository. Specifically, here is a tribute to one of the earliest programming languages ever made, by possibly the youngest person to ever learn it  (I'm only 18)

what is Cobol? COBOL stands for Common Business Oriented Language. It is imperative, procedural, and object-oriented. A compiler is a computer program that takes other computer programs written in a high-level (source) language and coverts them into another program, machine code, which the computer can understand.
